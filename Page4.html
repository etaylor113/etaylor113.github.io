			<h1 class="header"> Why I love the Gym! </h1>
			<p class="textSizeP3"> I have always enjoyed challenging myself and finding new ways to push past boundaries. Going to the gym helps me clear my mind after a rough day and its a healthy way to blow off some steam after a long work day. I also think it's important to stay in shape because being healthy makes you feel better and more energized! </p>

			<p class="textSizeP4"> My favorite gym to go to is Anytime Fitness. They are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I can go as late as I want after work when no one is there and have the whole gym to myself!</p><br><br>

			<p class="textSizeP4"> In all honesty, I could have never imagined to be invested into the field of Information Technology. I was never hugely interested in computers growing up. I loved the outdoors and that's where I saw myself working all my life. That all changed the older I got and the longer the time I spent employed at Wisconsin Vision Associates. I became highly interested in creating things, anyting really. That's when I found coding. I saw the endless things that can be done with well executed code. The possibilities are endless. The purpose of this website is for me to understand the three most important languages that developers need to know, and explore the vast world of computer science.
